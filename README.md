# immerseGTECHO2

This project was created for the 2025 Immerse GT Hackathon, with a focus on the cutting-edge world of AR/VR. We competed in the sponsor track using the unreleased Snapchat Spectacles—a thrilling yet challenging experience, given how early-stage the hardware still is. Despite the hurdles, our team pushed forward and built something we're proud of: Echoes.

# ECHOES
Echoes is an immersive, multiplayer AR experience designed for Snapchat Spectacles. It enables users to record and "drop" audio notes at specific geolocations—anchoring voice messages to real-world spaces. Anyone wearing Spectacles can later return to those same spots to discover and listen to the messages left behind.

The concept introduces a new layer of interaction with the physical world, blending spatial memory, audio storytelling, and social media. Notes can be tagged with themes like “classes,” “friends only,” or “miscellaneous,” allowing for tailored experiences.

Some exciting use cases:

Audio Graffiti: Users can create custom audio tags only recognizable by friends or specific groups.

Business Engagement: Companies can drop audio Easter eggs at locations, revealing promotions or fun facts.

Education: Teachers can turn campuses into interactive learning trails, where studying becomes an exploratory AR journey.

All scripting was done in TypeScript, with visuals crafted in Lens Studio. The backend was built using Firebase, allowing seamless integration with users’ Snapchat accounts for authentication and storage.
